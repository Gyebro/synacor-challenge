A strange, electronic voice is projected into your mind:

  "Unusual setting detected!  Starting confirmation process!  Estimated time to completion: 1 billion years."

You wake up on a sandy beach with a slight headache.  The last thing you remember is activating that teleporter... but now you can't find it anywhere in your pack.  Someone seems to have drawn a message in the sand here:

    lVfSqITLZkYK

It begins to rain.  The message washes away.  You take a deep breath and feel firmly grounded in reality as the effects of the teleportation wear off.
