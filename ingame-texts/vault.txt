As you approach the vault door, the number on the vault door flashes white!  The hourglass is still running!  It flashes white!  You hear a click from the vault door.  The orb evaporates out of hour hands.

== Vault Door ==
You stand before the door to the vault; it has a large '30' carved into it.  Affixed to the wall near the door, there is a running hourglass which never seems to run out of sand.

The floor of this room is a large mosaic depicting the number '1'.

Congratulations; you have reached the end of the challenge!
